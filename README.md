# Alphabet-Book-Android-App
The target audience for the app is: Children between the ages of the ages of 5-12 years and low literate adult users, the reason why I chose this kind of audience is because this app help them learn letters of alphabets a bit better, kids these days know how use certain apps before they even know how to correctly spell their own names so this app will be more will more like interactive learning for them audience. People, especially young kids learn better when they enjoy what they are doing, they enjoy playing games more than they enjoy having. Plus, children most kids these days prefer playing with apps on phones rather than playing with toys accessibility may not be that much of problem, parents even allow kids to download and play apps on their smart phone.
